# Library-DB-Schema
SQL schema and ER diagram for a Library Management System

Project Title: Library Management System – Database Schema Design

Task Objective:
This project demonstrates the creation of a relational database schema for a Library Management System using SQLiteStudio.

What I Did:
1. Chose "Library" as the domain for the database design.
2. Identified key entities: Authors, Books, Categories, Members, Loans, and BookAuthors.
3. Designed and created tables with appropriate fields, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.
4. Executed the SQL script in SQLiteStudio to create all tables.
5. Verified the schema and structure using the tool's interface.
6. Exported the schema and generated an ER diagram using dbdiagram.io.
7. Also identified Entities and Relationships
Entities:

a)Books
b)Authors
c)Members
d)Loans
e)Categories

Relationships:
a)A book can have one or more authors.
b)A member can borrow many books (Loans).
c)A book can belong to one category.

Tools Used:
- SQLiteStudio
- dbdiagram.io (for ER diagram visualization)

Outcome:
A well-structured and normalized schema for a library system database, ready for data entry and queries.
